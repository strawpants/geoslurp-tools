# geoslurp-tools
Collection of python tools to facilitate querying the [Geoslurp postgresql+postgis database](https://github.com/strawpants/geoslurp)

Although these tools are closely related to the geoslurp software and how these tables are defined there, it has no software dependencies on geoslurp and can be installed separately.


# UPDATE: 11 jan 2020:
This repository is now moved to the [Geoslurp repository](https://github.com/strawpants/geoslurp). Note that the queary functionality will be mainly in the discovery directory there.

This repository will not longer be maintained

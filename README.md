# geoslurp-tools
Collection of python tools to facilitate querying the [Geoslurp postgresql+postgis database](https://github.com/strawpants/geoslurp)

Although these tools are closely related to the geoslurp software and how these tables are defined there, it has no software dependencies on geoslurp and can be installed separately.
